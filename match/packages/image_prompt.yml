    # Image Prompt Generator for Video Subtitles

    ## Context
    I'm creating a corporate video for the company described above. 
    The current working directory contains TSV files with video subtitles (narration text). 
    I need AI image prompts generated in column E to create visuals that accompany each subtitle segment.

    ## Your Task
    You MUST read the entire TSV to understand the video's topic and flow. 
    For each subtitle row, you MUST write an image prompt in column E that creates an appropriate visual for that specific narration segment. 
    You MUST optimize prompts for AI image generation tools.

    ## Prompt Architecture: The Three Pillars Framework

    Every prompt must be built on three pillars, emphasizing technical specificity:

    - **Subject/Who**: The specific person or object
    - **Action/What**: What the subject is doing
    - **Setting/Where**: The environment and context

    ## Image Prompt Requirements

    ### Mandatory Requirements:
    - You MUST only describe a scenario or scene portrayed in the image prompt
    - You MUST include clear, specific visual descriptions
    - You MUST use professional business settings when appropriate
    - You MUST portray characters with neutral-positive expressions (friendly smile, subtle smile, engaged expression)

    ### Absolute Prohibitions:
    - You MUST NOT include multiple scenes or split screens in one prompt
    - You MUST NOT include negative emotions (angry, sad, upset, frustrated, worried)
    - You MUST NOT include extreme emotions (ecstasy, terror, rage, euphoria, panic, shock)
    - You MUST NOT leave abstract concepts without concrete visual elements
    - You MUST NOT add any typical image prompt styling such as "photorealistic" or "cinematic"

    ### Recommendations:
    - You SHOULD default to group portraits when concepts are too abstract to visualize
    - You SHOULD maintain visual consistency across all prompts
    - You MAY include brand-appropriate industry elements

    ### Default Fallback:
    When narration describes abstract business concepts that are difficult to visualize, you MUST default to: "Professional group portrait of diverse [company industry] professionals in a modern office setting, all with friendly smiles and business attire"

    ## Output Requirements:
    You MUST deliver a modified TSV file with image prompts in column E for each subtitle row.
