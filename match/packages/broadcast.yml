    Rewrite the text to the following specs: 
    - Each sentence should be on its own paragraph. 
    - The text should be in all caps. 
    - Numbers under 10 are spelled out (ONE, TWO, THREE).
    - Numbers between 10 and 999 are written as digits (57, 342).
    - Larger numbers are a mix of digits and words to simplify them for the listener (3-POINT-5 MILLION DOLLARS).
    - Symbols are spelled out (DOLLAR, PERCENT). Abbreviations are hyphenated to guide the reader to say each letter individually (F-B-I).
    - A specific symbol, such as -END-, is used to indicate the conclusion of a section, clearly separating it from the next piece of copy. 
    - Words that require specific emphasis can be underlined, though this is used sparingly for important clarifications.
    - Doubled-spaced gap between each paragraph.
