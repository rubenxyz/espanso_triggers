# cflake - Python code quality check
- trigger: "cflake"
  replace: "Please thoroughly review my Python codebase to ensure it's clean, efficient, and free of issues. Use Flake8 to find any unused imports that are cluttering the code. Check with Pylint to identify potential logical errors or quality problems. Apply Mypy to catch any type-related mistakes that could cause issues. Also, look for the ten largest Python files, as they might be bloated and need attention. Combine the findings from these tools and give me a clear, concise summary of the top five issues—such as unused code, style problems, type errors, or oversized files—along with specific suggestions for cleaning them up. Make sure I can review everything before any changes are applied."
