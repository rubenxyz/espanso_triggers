# Execute all TODO tasks
- trigger: "ctodoexe"
  replace: |
    Execute the tasks in TODO.md systematically.

     Work through the TODO items in order:
     1. Check off completed items with [x]
     2. Implement each task following my coding manifesto principles
     3. Test each component as you build it
     4. Update TODO.md with your progress

     Focus on making it work first, keeping it simple, and following the established patterns.

     CRITICAL: Complete ALL the tasks in TODO.md and don't stop until they are all completed. 

#======================================================================================  
# Update TODO status based on codebase
- trigger: "ctodoupdate"
  replace: |
    Analyze the current state of the codebase and update TODO.md to reflect what has been completed and what remains to be done.

    Your task:
    1. **Review Existing Code**: Examine all project files to understand what has been implemented
    2. **Check TODO.md**: Read the current TODO.md to see the task list
    3. **Update Status**: Mark completed tasks with [x] based on actual implementation
    4. **Add Missing Tasks**: If you find issues or incomplete work not listed, add them to the appropriate section
    5. **Remove Obsolete Tasks**: Remove any tasks that are no longer relevant given the current implementation

    Focus on accuracy - only mark items as complete if they are truly finished and working.
    Update the TODO.md file to reflect the current reality of the project.

#======================================================================================  
# Remove completed tasks from TODO
- trigger: "ctodoclean"
  replace: |
    Clean up the TODO.md file to prepare for the next development session.

    Your task:
    1. **Read TODO.md**: Open the current TODO.md file
    2. **Remove ALL Content**: Delete everything - all tasks (completed [x] and incomplete [ ]), headers, notes
    3. **Leave File Empty**: The TODO.md should be completely blank
    4. **Move Notes to CLAUDE.md**: If there are any important notes, reminders, or context in TODO.md, append them to CLAUDE.md

    CRITICAL: TODO.md must be a completely blank file after cleanup. Any persistent documentation belongs in CLAUDE.md.
    Make TODO.md empty for the next fresh start.

#======================================================================================  
# Add stop marker to prevent scope creep
- trigger: "ctodostop"
  replace: |
    Add a clear boundary marker to TODO.md to indicate where core functionality ends.

    Your task:
    1. **Check TODO.md**: Read the current TODO.md file
    2. **Look for Marker**: Check if the STOP HERE marker already exists
    3. **Add if Missing**: If not present, add the following to the end of TODO.md:

    ### ⛔ STOP HERE ⛔
    ### DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER REQUEST
    ### THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY IS COMPLETE

    This helps prevent scope creep and keeps development focused on essential features.
    Only add the marker if it's not already present in the file.
