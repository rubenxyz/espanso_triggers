# Review coding philosophy for feaures
- trigger: "new1"
  replace: |
    I need you to thoroughly understand my coding philosophy and constraints.

    Please read and analyze these two documents:
    1. `USER-FILES/00.KB/code_manifesto_memo.md`: My coding philosophy and principles
    2. `USER-FILES/00.KB/code_quantity_memo.md`: My file size management guidelines

    After reading both documents, provide a brief summary of the key principles I follow and any potential tensions or trade-offs between different principles that I should be aware of when planning Python projects.

    Confirm you understand these principles before we proceed to the feaure implementation process.
    Also, when you respond, end your response with "Give me new2".

#======================================================================================  
# Analyze feaure and generate questions
- trigger: "new2"
  replace: |
    Your task is to analyze a raw idea for a new feaure/behavior for the project and generate clarifying questions to ensure it adheres to my established principles.  
    I have provided three files:  
    1. `USER-FILES/07.TEMP/new_feaure.md`: This is a rough outline of the new feaure idea.  
    2. `USER-FILES/07.TEMP/new_feaure_questions.md`: This is the target output file.

    Your process should be as follows:

    1. **Analyze the Request**: Review new_feaure.md to understand the core functionality and goals, ensuring alignment with my coding philosophy (minimalism, one tool/one purpose, etc.).  
    2. **Generate Questions**: Critically analyze the synthesis and create `USER-FILES/07.TEMP/new_feaure_questions.md` with specific questions about any conflicts between the idea brief and my coding philosophy, unclear technical approaches, or areas needing clarification.

    In the new_feaure_questions.md file after each question there should be a response form for the user:

    **USER RESPONSE:**
    ```
    [WRITE RESPONSE HERE]
    ```

    Also, when you respond, end your response with "Review my question!!! Then give me new3".

# fea-todo - Convert feaure specification to actionable development tasks 
- trigger: "new3"
  replace: |
    Parse /USER-FILES/07.TEMP/new_feaure.md and generate structured TODO tasks. Write all tasks directly to /TODO.md file. For each feaure requirement:

    1. Extract the specific feaure component, acceptance criteria, and dependencies
    2. Categorize the task type (API, UI, database, testing, documentation, etc.)
    3. Generate a specific implementation action with technical approach
    4. Estimate effort (1-3 story points) and add appropriate labels

    Structure each TODO as:
    ```
    - [ ] **[COMPONENT_TYPE]** Implement `feaure_name` 
      - Requirement: [specific feaure requirement]
      - Action: [exact implementation approach]
      - Impact: [user benefit/business value]
      - Effort: [1-3 points] | Priority: [High/Med/Low]
    ```

    Group tasks by component/layer (Frontend, Backend, Database, Testing) and sort by dependency order. Add feaure specification timestamps and create cross-references for related tasks that should be implemented together. Append new tasks to existing /TODO.md content.

    Once you are done, and you respond, end your response with "Give me new4".

#======================================================================================  
# Execute feaure tasks systematically  
- trigger: "new4"
  replace: |
    Execute the tasks in TODO.md systematically.

     Work through the TODO items in order:
     1. Check off completed items with [x]
     2. Implement each task following my coding manifesto principles
     3. Test each component as you build it
     4. Update TODO.md with your progress

     Focus on making it work first, keeping it simple, and following the established patterns.
     
     CRITICAL: Complete ALL the newly added feaure tasks in TODO.md and don't stop until they are all completed. 

     Also, when you respond, end your response with "Give me new5".

#======================================================================================  
# Update TODO status based on codebase
- trigger: "new5"
  replace: |
    Analyze the current state of the codebase and update TODO.md to reflect what has been completed and what remains to be done.

    Your task:
    1. **Review Existing Code**: Examine all project files to understand what has been implemented
    2. **Check TODO.md**: Read the current TODO.md to see the task list
    3. **Update Status**: Mark completed tasks with [x] based on actual implementation
    4. **Add Missing Tasks**: If you find issues or incomplete work not listed, add them to the appropriate section
    5. **Remove Obsolete Tasks**: Remove any tasks that are no longer relevant given the current implementation

    Focus on accuracy - only mark items as complete if they are truly finished and working.
    Update the TODO.md file to reflect the current reality of the project.

    Also, when you respond, end your response with "Give me new6"

#======================================================================================  
# Clean up completed tasks from TODO
- trigger: "new6"
  replace: |
    Clean up the TODO.md file to prepare for the next development session.

    Your task:
    1. **Read TODO.md**: Open the current TODO.md file
    2. **Remove ALL Content**: Delete all tasks (both completed [x] and incomplete [ ])
    3. **Leave File Empty**: The TODO.md should be completely blank for the next session
    4. **Move Notes to CLAUDE.md**: If there are any important notes, reminders, or context in TODO.md, move them to CLAUDE.md instead

    IMPORTANT: TODO.md should be a blank slate after this cleanup. Any persistent notes belong in CLAUDE.md.

    Also, when you respond, end your response with "You're all done! The newure has been implemented and TODO.md is ready for the next session."
